# Module 3 Challenge

## PyBank

In this Challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. I am given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**The analysis should align with the following results:**

In addition, to my final script I also print the analysis terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

In this Challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I am given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

**The analysis should align with the following results:**
